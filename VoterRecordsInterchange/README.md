# Voting - Voter Records Interchange (VRI) CDF Specification

This directory holds voter records interchange (VRI) specification common data format and related information and files that are being created by NIST and collaborators.  

The VRI specification will support the following list of use cases:

1. Digital VR applications transmitted within State OVR systems, or to state OVR systems by third party OVR systems, or by Motor Vehicle or other NVRA agencies, including digital versions of the NVRA form, the FPCA form, or state specific forms.

2. Similar applications for voter registration update (change of name, change of address); absentee ballot request; change of voter status, or type of requested modification already supported in NVRA form, FPCA form, or state specific forms.

3. Subsets of such digital applications used for 3rd-party registrars to transfer users and user data to state OVR systems, or for Motor Vehicle or other NVRA agencies to transfer customer data to state OVR systems.

4. Subsets of such digital applications exchanged between state VR systems and DMV or similar systems, to perform driver's license data matching as part of OVR processing.

5. Data exchanged by DMV or similar systems and VR systems, as part of NVRA compliance to digitally notify VR systems of DMV records of DMV customers that requested new voter registration; similar data push from DMV of existing DMV records recently updated with change-of-address, as part of semi-automated steps toward permanent voter registration; other forms of data exchange to VR systems that might facilitate elements of automatic and/or permanent voter registration.

6. Data interchange between state VR systems for records matching (e.g. Kansas Project activity, or use of the ERIC system).

7. Subsets of voter records externalized from voter records systems for purposes of data aggregation and reporting, including but not limited to EAVS reporting
