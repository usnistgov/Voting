# Voting - Election Common Data Format Project

This repository holds election common data format (CDF) and related information and files that are being created by NIST and collaborators.  

NIST's election CDF project has the goal of (a) specifying a common import/export format for election devices such as electronic pollbooks, election management systems, and vote capture devices, and (b) specifying a comprehensive foundational UML models that will cover election data in general.  The model defines the various objects (e.g., candidates, contests, offices, etc.) and their associated attributes, and specifies the relationships between and among the objects.  It includes a glossary and other tools to ensure that the implementations of the model (e.g., XML or JSON formats) are consistent in style, definition, and composition.

There are currently 4 CDF projects under active development in this repository:

1. Cast Vote Records - created by scanners or DREs, contain tabulatable voter choices - the repository is now located at https://github.com/usnistgov/CastVoteRecords
2. Election Event Logging - election-related events logged by election devices - the repository is now located at https://github.com/usnistgov/ElectionEventLogging
3. Election Results Reporting - pre- and post-election information and results - the repository is now located at https://github.com/usnistgov/ElectionResultsReporting
4. Voter Records Interchange - voter registration-related information to support voter registration, electronic pollbooks, and voter registration database exchanges - the repository is now located at https://github.com/usnistgov/VoterRecordsInterchange
